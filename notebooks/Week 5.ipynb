    "# Week 4 - Objects, Modules, Pandas and Regular Expressions\n",
    "This week we will review what really makes Python so useful, packages written by others that you can use to do things better, faster, easier. In turn, we will start to discuss how a project can be worked on collaboratively if the code is organized in a way that allows for easy distribution of work. This is done by making your own objects and modules to do repeatable tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will work on regular expressions and Pandas. Regular Expressions help to utilize wildcards for handling text to help solve multiple issues at once in cleaning data, while Pandas is the be-all end-all data cleansing and management tool in Python that any analyst has to know to get the most our of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should also point out that much of the regular expressions package is built into Pandas as well. This both illustrates the value of the core package (re - regular expressions), and helps illustrate how reusable code can be built into new packages to help make it easier to use.\n",
